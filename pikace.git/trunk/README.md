## How does it work?

You can see a demo [here](https://thomasorus.github.io/Chisai/). It's quite simple:

- Each section is a folder with files named as the dates of their publication.
- Each section has it's parent section that regroups all the files inside.
- All sections 5 latest entries are regrouped on the home page with a link to see the full content.
- Content is edited using the Markdown syntax (the same you can find on Discord or Slack).
- Edit the content (create folders, files, edit files) directly on github, here!

That's all!
